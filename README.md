# AudioPlayer

This was my final project in an Android programming course. This app will need a bit of rework to run on an Android over API 22 namely the new request permission.

I was given a basic structure for this app it would play 30 sec of a song and randomly move on to the next song, or you could click the play, next(random song), stop, or stop service buttons.
I added being able to select by Arist or album, the slider to fast forward or rewinding a song, the information being displayed about the track that is playing, pulling and displaying the album art or a no art image if the track did not have an album cover.
The type selection under "chooser" is not working right at this time.
